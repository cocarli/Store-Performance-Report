# ðŸ“Š Store Performance Report (Valvoline-Inspired)

## About This Project

This Excel project is inspired by my professional experience working at Valvoline.  
It simulates a **Store Performance Report** designed to track key sales metrics over different time periods:
- **Current Day**
- **Current Week**
- **Current Month**
- **Last Month**

Each sheet contains:
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** like Average Ticket, Discounts, Core NOCR, and Total NOCR
- A detailed breakdown of **services sold** (units and revenue)
- Simple, clean **charts** to visualize the data

All data in this project is **fictional** and was created for portfolio purposes.
